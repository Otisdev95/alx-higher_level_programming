<h1>Python - Object-relational mapping</h1>
<h3>Background Context</h3>
<p>In this project, I linked two amazing worlds: Databases and Python!</p>
<p>In the first part, i used the module MySQLdb to connect to a MySQL database and executed my SQL queries.</p>
<p>In the second part, i used the module SQLAlchemy (don’t ask me how to pronounce it…) an Object Relational Mapper (ORM).</p>
<p>The biggest difference is: no more SQL queries! Indeed, the purpose of an ORM is to abstract the storage to the usage. With an ORM, my biggest concern was “What can I do with my objects” and not “How this object is stored? where? when?”. I didn't write any SQL queries only Python code. Last thing, my code is not “storage type” dependent. I am able to change my storage easily without re-writing my entire project.</p>
